## Welcome to our intro space üëã

This is your place to go to get some hands-on tips on how to make our mutual contribution experience to <INSERT_YOUR_OSS_ORG_NAME> Community repos the best out there! We strongly believe in power of open source software, that's why we're putting together this repo to make your contributions and our collaboration as smooth as possible ü§ù As we're always in the process of improving, there will be gradual changes implemented to this repo as well as <INSERT_YOUR_OSS_ORG_NAME> contributing experience in general. Keep your fingers crossed and watch out for further improvements ü§ûüèº

## üëã Intro

To begin with, we need to get to know a few terms and concepts so as to avoid misunderstanding while co-operating and communicating in the future:

* **Community repo:** a repo that belongs to <INSERT_YOUR_OSS_ORG_NAME> organisation
* **Community contributor / developer:** someone who contributes to community repos via code, docs improvements, PRs / issues discussion
* **Community admins:** <INSERT_YOUR_OSS_ORG_URL> Community Team members

As we're growing our OSS community we'd like you to gradually take more and more control over those repos and become community maintainers as well. We're working hard on making your experience in <INSERT_YOUR_OSS_ORG_NAME> repos better day by day.

## ü¶∂ First Steps

Before making your first contribution to any of our repos, we highly recommend checking following files:

<!-- TODO: Make sure to adjust links to those documents -->

* [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/konradsopala/oss-org-getting-started/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/konradsopala/oss-org-getting-started/blob/master/CONTRIBUTION.md)
* [License](https://github.com/konradsopala/oss-org-getting-started/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

that apply to each of our repos and will give you some insight on how to do stuff and stuff that is not allowed in there. We designed it having your best contributor experience in mind!

## üëÆ Permissions and rights

<!-- TODO: Make sure to adjust links to those documents -->

You can find **all permissions, rights and dont-do things in [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/konradsopala/oss-org-getting-started/blob/master/CONTRIBUTION.md)** as well as in our **[code of conduct](https://github.com/konradsopala/oss-org-getting-started/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).**

We strongly believe that those two documents will evolve over time so as to fulfil our community needs even better as our community grows and gets more experienced and mature. We want to keep all our efforts transparent, that's why we're always open for your feedback! You can submit it either with an issue or simply by contacting us at <INSERT_YOUR_OSS_ORG_EMAIL>.

## üì† Syncing and communicating

We'd really love to have our collaboration flourish on all grounds and we think that establishing some processes around syncing and communicating are crucial to this. We'd like to introduce Slack guest channels or even host monthly webinars for community contributors at some point for the purpose of regular syncs and we're currently evaluating those options but for now we want to use following tools to make most out of our communication:

* **PRs' comments**: PRs-related discussions
* **Issues' comments**: Issues-related discussions

As everyone is time-constraint and we do sometimes have limited bandwidth we want everyone to make their contribution toward discussing, reviewing and solving/merging issues and PRs! We're all in this together! ü§úüèºü§õüèª
