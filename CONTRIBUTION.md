# ü§ì How to contribute to <INSERT_YOUR_OSS_ORG_NAME> repos

All repos in this organisation are open source projects. We welcome contributions of all forms! Came across a bug in any of our repos? Have an idea for some kind of improvement? Below you can find some guidelines on how to contribute, so as to make it work for the whole community in the long run!

We are working on making the open-source contribution experience in these repos more smooth and we plan to implement a variety of improvements to make that happen. In the meanwhile, if you want to start/continue contributing in the right way to these repos, please refer to this file.

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Code of Conduct

<INSERT_YOUR_OSS_ORG_NAME> organisation has a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/konradsopala/oss-org-getting-started/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to which all contributors must adhere.

### üõ†Ô∏è Pull requests

Wondering how PRs work in our repos? Here's a quick rundown:

* Please search all open and closed PRs before submitting a new one.
* Clone the repo
* Check out the README file of the project for information specific to that project
* Create yourself a branch out of master
  * Name it descriptively so that others can understand who is working here and what this specific branch will contain e.g. *superUser-tokenRetrieval-fix*
* Commit appropriate changes to your branch
  * Remember that setting proper commit messages is essential for navigating through branch changes
  * Feel free to branch out of your branch to propose new changes as long as it makes sense and will be clear for the reviewer
* Open a [pull request](https://github.com/konradsopala/oss-org-getting-started/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and provide some description that you consider helpful for the reviewer. It can be anything from the issue or bug number associated with your change, to your implementation specifics
  * The more descriptive title of PR / issue the faster it will potentially get addressed
  * For faster tracking and more convenient review process, if you've discussed it before with someone in our community and you know who potentially can review your changes, add this person as an assignee to your PR
* Implement requested changes and eventually have your code merged by the reviewer. **Never merge your code yourself!**
  * To make sure we can ship quality code and create useful tools for the whole community, before one's pull request can be merged, it needs approval from at least two reviewers

**The Golden PR rule: Instead of one huge PR go for a few smaller ones!**



### üîß Issues

Found a bug in any of our org repos? Here's more on how to report that so the community can get it fixed as soon as possible:

* Before you submit a new issue please make sure to search all open and closed issues. It is possible your feature request/issue has already been answered. If not, go to the next step
* Open an [issue](https://github.com/konradsopala/oss-org-getting-started/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) and provide as detailed issue description as possible
* If you feel like posting any screenshots that you consider helpful, go for it
* Include what is your expected result and what actually happens
* Provide steps to reproduce the issue
* If you're having issue with some framework / language / tool specific version, please provide its version

#### üóùÔ∏è Old issues

If an issue has been out there open for more than 90 days, we close them automatically. The aim of it is to ensure that new issues can be tracked more easily and old issues that are no longer relevant are closed.

### Review
